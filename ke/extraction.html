            <h3 style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 3. THE DURSLEYS DEPARTING</h3>
<p>The sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stair and a voice
yelled, “Oi, You!” Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry
in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not
immediately respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for
a split second, he had thought he say Dumbledore’s eye. It was not until his
uncle bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the
bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled
with things he would be taking with him.<br>
“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the
top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”<br>
Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he
reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for
traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmoncolored
coat, and Dudly, Harry’s large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather
jacket.<br>
“Yes?” asked Harry.<br>
“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. “Please!” added
Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.<br>
Harry sat. He though he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace
up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious
expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled with concentration, Uncle
Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.
“I’ve changed my mind,,” he said.
“What a surprise,” said Harry.<br>
“Don’t you talk in that tone—” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but
Vern Dursley waved her down.<br>
“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy
little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re staying put, we’re
not going anywhere.”<br>
Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement.
Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for
the past four weeks, packing and unpacking ad repacking the car with every
change of heart. Harry’s favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon,
unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last
time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and
collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pacing up and
down the living room, “we—Petunia, Dudley, and I—are in danger. From—
from—”<br>
“Some of my ’my lot,’ right,” said Harry.<br>
“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of
Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it’s over, and I believe it’s a
plot to get the house.”<br>
“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”<br>
“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead starting to
pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us
out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit of hocus-pocus and before we
know it the deeds will my in your name and—”
“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this house? Are
you actually as stupid as you look?”<br>
“Don’t you dare—!” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon waved her
down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the
danger he has spotted.<br>
“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a house, my
godfather left me one. So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?”
There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with
this argument.<br>
“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that this Lord
Thing—”<br>
“—Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through this about
a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dumbledore told you last
year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley—”<br>
Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his
uncle was attempting to ward of recollections of the unannounced visit, a few
days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on
the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most
unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr.
Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could
not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.<br>
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“—Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry pressed on remorselessly.
“Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will
break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will
target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because
he thinks by holding you hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”</span><br>
Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant
they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and
Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help.
You’re being offered serious protection, the best there is.”<br>
Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside
the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbor’s lawn mower
stalled again.<br>
“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Dursley abruptly.
  <br>
“There is,” said Harry, surprised.
<br>
“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent
victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to
qualify for government protection!”
<br>
Harry laughed; he could not stop himself. It was so typical of his uncle to
put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised
and mistrusted.
<br>
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied. “We think
the Ministry has been infiltrated.”</span>
<br>
Uncle Vernon stroke to the fireplace and back, breathing so heavily that his
great black mustache tippled, his face still purple with concentration.
<br>
“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All right, let’s say,
for the sake of argument, we accept this protection. I still don’t see why we
can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”
<br>
Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question has
also been addressed half a dozen times.<br>
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth. “Kingsley is protecting the Mug—I mean, your Prime Minister.”</span><br>
“Exactly—he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television
screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along
discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and
the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not
to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused
the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with
any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his
earring in.<br>
“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are
more than up to the job—”<br>
“If we’d even seen CVs . . . ” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost patience.
Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set him35
self.<br>
“These accidents aren’t accidents—the crashes and explosions and derailments
and whatever else has happened since we last watched the new. People
are disappearing and dying and he’s behind it—Voldemort. I’ve told you this
over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the fogs—they’re caused
by dementors, and if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!”
Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents’ and
Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, “There are
. . . more of them?”<br>
“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you mean?
Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing
as they feed of fear and despair—”<br>
“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made your point—”
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them—Death
Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi—which means dead bodies enchanted
by a Dark Wizard—will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. And
if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree
you need help.”</span><br>
There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing
something down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening
years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon; Dudley was staring
at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But what about my work?
What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of
layabout wizards—”<br>
“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and kill you like
they did my parents!”<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad—I’m going with these Order people.”</span><br>
“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talking sense.”
He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept
the Order’s help, his parents would accompany him: There could be no question
of being separated from their Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock
on the mantelpiece.<br>
“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none of the Dursleys
replied, he left the room.<span property="cosmo:identity"> The prospect of parting—probably forever—from
his aunt, uncle, and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite
cheerfully, but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What
did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?</span>
Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack, then poked
a couple of own nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage. They fell with dull
thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them.<br>
“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll be able to
fly again.”<br>
The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and
downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the
Dursleys on their own. <br>
“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened
the door, a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping him a deep bow. “An
honor, as ever!”<br>
“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile
upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of you to do this . . . They’re
through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin . . . ”<br>
“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus happily, striding
into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed
thus; Harry half expected another change of mind. Dudley shrank nearer to
his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard.<br>
“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told
you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his
waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to
the danger of using magic in your house—Harry being still underage, it could
provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him—we shall be driving, say,
ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out
for you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon politely.
“Know how to—? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!” spluttered
Uncle Vernon.<br>
“Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled
by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus. He was clearly under the
impression that he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence
in the plan with every word Dedalus spoke.<br>
“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling
indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus or Hestia seemed to hear him.
“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard. There has
been a little change in the arrangements—”<br>
“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was going to
come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”<br>
“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”<br>
The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension
on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched, “Hurry up!” Harry
looked all around the room before realizing that the voice had issued from
Dedalus’s pocket watch.<br>
“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said Dedalus, nodding
at his watch and tucking it back into his waistcoat. “We are attempting to
time your departure from the house with your family’s Disapparition, Harry:
thus, the charm breaks as the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to
the Dursleys. “Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”<br>
None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, appalled, at
the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket.<br>
“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured Hestia.
She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain in the room while
Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, possibly tearful farewells.
“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further
explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,<br>
“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”<br>
He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the last
moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging
it backward and forward like a metronome.<br>
“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag
so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding
Harry a little of the giant, Grawp.<br>
“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon.
He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, “I
don’t understand.”
“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, looking up at
her son.<br>
Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry.
“Why isn’t he coming with us?”<br>
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze where they stood, staring at Dudley
as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina.
“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.
“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.<br>
“Well, he—he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry
and asking, “You don’t want to, do you?”<br>
“Not in the slightest,” said Harry.<br>
“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on, we’re off.”
He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley
did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too.
“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway.
It seems that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into
words. After sever moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said,
“But where’s he going to go?”<br>
Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that
Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the silence.
“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she asked, looking
bewildered.<br>
“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some of your lot,
isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard the man, we’re in a hurry,”
Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not
follow.<br><br>
“Off with some of our lot?” Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before. Witches and
wizards seems stunned that his closest living relatives took so little interest in
the famous Harry Potter.<br>
“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”
“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously. “Don’t these
people realize what you’ve been through? What dangers you are in? The unique
position you hold in the hearts of the anti-Voldemort movement?”
“Er—no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a wast of space actually,
but I’m used to—”<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“I don’t think you’re a wast of space.”
If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have believed it. As
it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must
have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing. Dudley had turned red.
Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself.<br>
“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”
Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression
before mumbling, “You saved my life.”</span><br>
“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would have taken
. . . ”<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during
this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept
to his room so much. It now dawned on Harry, however, that the cup of cold
tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at
all. Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley
appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings.</span> After opening
his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-faced silence.
Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that
changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather
than Harry.<br>
“S—so sweet, Dudders . . . ” she sobbed into his massive chest. “S-such a
lovely b-boy . . . s-saying thank you . . . ”<br>
“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He only said
he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”<br>
“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ’I love you,”’ said Harry, torn
between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch
at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from a burning building.<br>
“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the
living room door. “I though we were on a tight schedule!”<br>
“Yes—yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanges
with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together.<br>
“We really must be off, Harry—”<br>
He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his own.
“—good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest
upon your shoulders.”<br>
“Oh,” said Harry. “right. Thanks.”<br>
“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our thoughts go
with you.”<br>
“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia
and Dudley.<br>
“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle lightly, waving
his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him.<br>
<span property="cosmo:symmetry">Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and walked toward
Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then
Dudley held out his large, pink hand.
“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs. “did the
dementors blow a different personality into you?”
“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . ” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it. “Maybe. Take
care, Big D.”
Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room.</span> Harry heard his heavy
footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door slammed.<br>
Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around
at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with
Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket, she said, “Well—
good-bye,” and marched toward the door without looking at him.<br>
“Good-bye,” said Harry.<br>
She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling
that she wanted to say something to him. She gave him an odd, tremulous look
and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her
head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.<br></p>

      <div id="content2">
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD</h3>
<p>Harry had not expected Hermione’s anger to abate overnight, and
was therefore unsurprised that she communicated mainly by dirty
looks and pointed silences the next morning. Ron responded by
maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward
sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry
felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few
moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching
the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became shamelessly cheery.
“Someone helped us.” he kept saying. “Someone sent that doe. Someone’s
on our side. One Horcrux down, mate!”<br>
Bolstered by the destruction of the locket, they set to debating the possible
locations of the other Horcruxes, and even though they had discussed the
matter so often before, Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs
would succeed the first. Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits;
<span property="cosmo:symmetry">The sudden upswing in their fortunes, they appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.</span><br>
Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s baleful presence again,
and under the pretense of scouting the bare hedges for nonexistent blackber-<br>
ries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed
to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione’s various wanderings,
right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was
now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding
world during his weeks away.<br>
“ . . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry after explaining
the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.<br>
“The what?”<br>
“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s name!”<br>
“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said Harry. “But I
haven’t got a problem calling him V—”<br>
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a boot at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. “Sorry.” said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of hte brambles, “but the name’s been jinxed. Harry, that’s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective
enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance—it’s how they found
us in Totenham Court Road!”</span><br>
“Because we used his name?”<br>
“Exactly! You’ve got to give htem credit, it makes sense. It was only people
who were serious about standing up to him like Dumbledore, who ever dared
use it. Now they’ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable—quickand-
easy way to find they Order members! They nearly got Kingsley—”<br>
“You’re kidding?”<br>
“Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his
way out. He’s on the run now, just like us.” Ron scratched his chin thoughfully
with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?”
“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?”<br>
“Oh yeah . . . ”<br>
They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione.<br>
“Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?”<br>
“Dumbledore what?”<br>
Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, “Dumbledore . . . the
doe? I mean,” Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, “he had
the real sword last, didn’t he?”<br>
Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind
the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to
them, that he was watching over them, would have been inexpressibly comforting.
He shook his head.<br>
“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body. He’s definitely
gone. Anyway, his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe.”<br>
“Patronuses can change, though, can’t they?” said Ron. “Tonks’s changed,
didn’t it?”<br>
“Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn’t he show himself? Why
wouldn’t he just hand us the sword?”<br>
“Search me,” said Ron. “Same reason he didn’t give it to you while he was
alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kids’
stories?”<br>
“Which is what?” asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face, desperate
for the answer.<br>
‘I dunno,” said Ron. <span property="cosmo:identity">“Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or—or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He—well,” Ron’s ears turned bright red and he
became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe,
“he must’ve known I’d run out on you.”<br>
“No,” Harry corrected him. “He must’ve know you’d always want to come
back.”<br>
Ron looked grateful, but still awkward.</span> Partly to change the subject, Harry
said, “Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about
him?”<br>
“Oh yeah,” said Ron at once. “people are talking about it quite a lot. ’Course,
if things were different, it’d be huge news. Dumbledore being pals with Grindel338
CHAPTER 20. XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
wald, but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who didn’t like
Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who though he was
such a good bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really
young when they—”<br>
“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something
in his face seemed to decide Ron against persuing the subject.
A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry
took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which
Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of
blackthorn.<br>
“Engorgio.”<br>
The spider game a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried
again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.<br>
“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young,
okay?”<br>
Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders.<br>
“Sorry—Reducio.”<br>
The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every
minor spell he had cast with it so far tha day had seemed less powerful
than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively
unfamiliar, like having sombody else’s hand sown to the end of his arm.
“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly
from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge
and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of confidence, Harry.”<br>
He knew why she wanted to be right: She still felt guilty about breaking
his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his lips, that she could take the
blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers
instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when
Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her
book once more.<br>
All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took
first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand
levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less
powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading,
while <span property="cosmo:symmetry">Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.
“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that tells the news
like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s side and are following
the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait till you hear it, it’s great. Only they
can’t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they’re
raided, and you need a password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the lsat
one. . . . ”</span><br>
He drummed lightly on top of the radio with his wand, muttering random
words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing
an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have
been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered. Hermione turned
the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn
wand.<br>
Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at
once.<br>
“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously.<br>
Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.<br>
“We need to talk,” she said.<br>
He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of
Albus Dumbledore.<br>
“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a
chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s verison of
his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione’s answer, however, was completedly
unexpected.<br>
“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.”<br>
He stared at her.<br>
“Sorry?”<br>
“Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to him!”<br>
“Er—why?”<br>
She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s that mark,
the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!”<br>
She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s unwilling
eyes as he saw a photograph of the original letter than Dumbledore had written
Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated
seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had writen those words, that they
had not been Rita’s invention.<br>
“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!”
He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about,
but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wang, he saw that Dumbledore
had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark
inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.<br>
“Er—what are you—?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with
a look and turned back to Harry.<br>
<span property="cosmo:brightness">“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means—I
don’t even know if Grindelwald’s stil alive—but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. he
was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important, Harry!”</span><br>
Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face
and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he
said, “Hermione, we don’t need another Godric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves
into going there, and—”<br>
“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore’s left he The Tales of Beedle
the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out about the sign?”
“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exaperated. “We keep trying to
convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues—”<br>
“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up Ron. “I think
Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.”<br>
Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s support of
Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular
rune.<br>
“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on your side,
Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve
got to help you!”<br>
“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.
“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it
before he died?”<br>
“Maybe . . .maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,” said
Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.<br>
“Yea,” said Ron syncophantically, “that makes sense.”<br>
“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought to talke to
Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s
Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!”
“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going to see
Lovegood—”<br>
His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered suspiciously
as she raised her own.<br>
“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.
“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve seen Lovegood,
let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? where do the Lovegoods
live, anyway? Do either of you know?”<br>
“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron.. “I dunno exactly where,
but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention the,.
Shouldn’t be hard to find.”<br>
When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice.
“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.”
“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of both. Cheer
up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”<br>
They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Cachpole from the
breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage
point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting
shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood
for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow their hands shadowing their
eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and tree of the orchard,
which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.
“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron.<br>
“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,”
said Hermione coldly.<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with and incredulous laugh. “Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you?Yeah, and Fred and George woud’ve been great about it. And ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”</span><br>
<span property="cosmo:symmetry">“But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised. “Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been decent to
me. He—he wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d done, but he didn’t go
on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family knew
I was there.</span> Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas
because they wanted to spend it alonge. You know, first holiday after they were
married. I don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina
Warbeck.”<br>
Ron turned his back on the Burrow.<br>
“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.
They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence, hidden beneath
the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited
apart from one small cotttage, which seemed deserted.<br>
“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?” said Hermione,
peering thorugh the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill.
Ron snorted.<br>
“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked<br>
through the Lovegood’s window. Let’s try the next lot of hills.<br>
So the Disapparated a few miles farther north.<br>
“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whippped their hair and clothes. Ron
was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared,
where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great
black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky.
“That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks
like a giant rook!”
“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower.<br>
“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”<br>
Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When
Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in
their sides, they found him grinning broadly.<br>
“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”<br>
Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down gate. The first
read,<br>
THE QUIBBLER, EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD<br>
the second,<br>
PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE<br>
the third,<br>
KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS<br>
The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front
door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in
the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry though
he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two
aged crab apple trees, beat with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavery
with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood
sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened,
hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.<br>
“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermione. “It’s you
Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.”<br>
He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag.
She the rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with
iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.<br>
Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood
Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained
nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius
had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur’s wedding by comparision.
“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried in a highpitched,
querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at
Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect comical O.
“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m Harry, Harry
Potter.”<br>
Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was not pointing
inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s forehead.
“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s sometihng we’d like
to ask you.”<br>
“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed
and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a shock . . .My word . . . I
. . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought to—”<br>
“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less than
warming welcome.<br>
“I—oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”<br>
they were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door
shut behind then. They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had
ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that it felt like being inside a
giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls—the stove, the sink,
and the cupboards—and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and
birds in bright primary colors. Harry though he recognized Luna’s style: The
effect in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.<br>
In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper
levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead:
Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.<br>
“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable,
and he led the way.<br>
The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace,
and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller
and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement
on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic
labryinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles
of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures
Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the
ceiling.<br>
Luna was not there; The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden
object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre
offspring of a workbench and a set of old shelves, but after a moment Harry decided
it was an old fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning
out Quibblers.<br>
“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized
a grubbly tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers,
which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling
the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.<br>
“Why have you come here?”<br>
Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione lot out a small cry of shock.
“Mr. Lovegood—what’s that?”<br>
She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a
unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the
room.<br>
“It is the horm of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius.
“No it isn’t!” said Hermione.<br>
“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the moment—”<br>
“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and
it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!”<br>
“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging away from the
horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.<br>
“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr.
Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode
at the slightest touch?”<br>
“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly, a mullish
look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn—”
“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s
an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibily dangerous—I don’t know where you got
it—”<br>
“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from a delightful
young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A
Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning to Harry, “why exactly
have you come here, Mr. Potter?”<br>
“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start again.
“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.”<br>
His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seems simultaneously terrified
and mesmerized.<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“Yes. The this is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather dangerous . . . ”
“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help
Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”<br>
Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging
and clattering beneath the tablecloth.<br>
“Er—yes, I have expressed that view. However—” “That’s for everyone else
to do, not you personally?” said Ron.</span><br>
<span property="cosmo:fictionalCharacter">Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between
the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some
painful interal struggle.</span><br>
“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione, “Let’s see what she thinks.”<br>
Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a
shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, “Luna is down
at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you.
I’ll go and call her and then—very well. I shall try to help you.”
He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front door
open and close. They looked at each other.<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ton times his guts.”</span><br>
<span property="cosmo:fictionalCharacter">He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry.</span><br>
“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone
else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake
keep away from that horn.”<br>
Harry crossed to the window of the far sid of the room. He could see a
stream, a thin, glittering rybbon lying far below them at the base of the hill.
They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the
direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was
over there somewhere. <span property="cosmo:brightness">They were closer to each other than they had been since Bill and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger. Xenophilius’s attitude proved that.</span>
He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar
object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a stone bust of a beautiful
but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two
object that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out form the sides. A tiny
pair of gliterring blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top
of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap
around her forehead.<br>
“Looking at this,” said Harry.<br>
“Fetching,” said Ron. “Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.”
They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius had climbed
back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encased inWelling348
ton boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.
“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the tray into
Hermione’s arms and joining Harry at the statue’s side. “Modeled, fittingly
enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw. ’Wit beyond measure
is a man’s greatest treasure!’”<br>
He indicated the objects like ear trumpets.<br>
“These are the Wrackspurt siphons—to remove all sources of distraction
from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out the tina wings, “a
billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,” he pointed to
the orange radish. “the Dirgible Plum, so as th enhance the ability to accept
the extraordinary.”<br>
Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to
balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.<br>
“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophilius. “We make
it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink, which was a deep purple as
beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most
excited that you are here. She ought not be too long, she has caught nearly
enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves
to sugar.<br>
“Now,” he removed a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down,
his Wellingtoned legs crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?”
“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly. “it’s
about that symbol you were wearing around you neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.”<br>
Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.<br>
“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to
the sign of the Deathly Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly
Hallows?” “Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">CHAPTER 37. EPILOGUE - NINETEEN YEARS LATER</h3>
Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the
first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the
little family bobbed across the rumbling road towards the great
sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled
like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large caged rattled on top of the laden trolleys
the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the
redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm.
“It won’t be long now, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her.<br>
“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!”<br>
The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way
towards the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s voice drifted back
to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument
they had started in the car.<br>
“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!”<br>
“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.<br>
“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger brother.<br>
“There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth—”<br>
But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached
the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger
brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment
later, he had vanished.<br>
“You’ll right to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing
on the momentary absence of his brother.<br>
“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny.<br>
“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only get letters
from home about once a month.”<br>
“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny.<br>
“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,”
Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”<br>
Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As
they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the
family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by
thick white steam which was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct
figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already
disappeared.<br>
“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they
passed as they made their way down the platform
“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly.<br>
But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody’s faces.
Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought
he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite
glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .<br>
“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly.<br>
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very
last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and
Albus had drawn right up beside them.<br>
“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.<br>
Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him.
“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione didn’t believe
I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I’d have to Confund
the examiner.”<br>
“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”<br>
“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to Harry, as together
they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train. “I only forgot to look in
the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.”
Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger brother,
having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into
when they finally went to Hogwarts.<br>
“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but no pressure.”
“Ron!”<br>
Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.<br>
“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer
paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to a point some
fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood
in sharp relief against the shifting mist.<br>
<span property="cosmo:darkness">“Look who it is.”<br>
Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned
up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized
the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled
Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him,
nodded curtly, and turned away again.</span><br>
“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure you beat
him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother’s brains.”
“Ron, for heaven’s sake,” said Hermione, half stern, half amused. “Don’t try
to turn them against each other before they’ve even started school!”
“You’re right, sorry,” said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, “Don’t
get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive
you if you married a pureblood.”<br>
“Hey!”<br>
James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley,
and was evidently bursting with news.<br>
“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder
into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And guess what he’s doing?
Snogging Victoire!”<br>
He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.
“Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked
Teddy what he was doing—”<br>
“You interrupted them?” said Ginny. “You are so like Ron—”
“—and he said he’d come to see her off! And then he told me to go away!
He’s snogging her!” James added as though worried he had not made himself
clear.<br>
“Oh, it would be lovely if they got married,” whispered Lily sarcastically.
“Teddy would really be part of the family then!”<br>
“He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,” said Harry.
“Why don’t we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?”
“Yeah!” said James enthusiastically. “I don’t mind sharing a room with
Al—Teddy could have my room!”<br>
“No,” said Harry firmly, “you and Al will share a room only when I want the
house demolished.”<br>
He checked the battered old watch which had once been Fabian Prewett’s.
“It’s nearly eleven, you’d better get on board.”
“Don’t forget to give Neville our love!” Ginny told James as she hugged him.
“Mum! I can’t give a professor love!”<br>
“But you know Neville!—”<br>
James rolled his eyes.<br>
“Outside, yeah, but at school he’s Professor Longbottom, isn’t he? I can’t
walk into Herbology and give him love. . . . ”<br>
Shaking his head at his mother’s foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming
a kick at Albus.<br>
“See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.”<br>
“I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!”<br>
But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father
a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him
wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.<br>
“Thestrals are nothing to worry about,” Harry told Albus. “They’re gentle
things, there’s nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won’t be going up to
school in the carriages, you’ll be going in the boats.”<br>
Ginny kissed Albus good-by.<br>
“See you at Christmas.”<br>
“By, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s invited
you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve
learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.”<br>
“What if I’m in Slytherin?”<br>
The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment
of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear
was.<br>
Harry crouched down so that Albus’s face was slightly above his own. Alone
of Harry’s three children, Albus had inherited Lily’s eyes.<br>
<span property="cosmo:identity">“Albus Severus,” Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear,
and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on
the train, “you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was
a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”<br>
“But just say—”<br>
“—then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it?
It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose
Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.”
“Really?”<br>
“It did for me,” said Harry.<br>
He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in
Albus’s face when he said it.</span> But now the doors were slamming all along the
scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for
final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny
closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned
towards Harry.<br>
“Why are they staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to
look at the other students.<br>
“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely famous.”
Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry
walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, already ablaze with excitement.
Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement,
watching his son glide away from him. . . .<br>
The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a
corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.<br>
“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny.<br>
As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched
the lightning scar on his forehead.<br>
“I know he will.”<br>
The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.<br>
